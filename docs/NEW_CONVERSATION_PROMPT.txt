# PROMPT FOR NEW CLAUDE CONVERSATIONS

Copy and paste this when starting a new conversation about the Migration Tool project:

---

Hi Claude! I'm continuing work on my Australian Migration Hub project (ANZSCO occupation search tool).

**Project Context:**
I'm building a Next.js app that helps people find visa-eligible occupations in Australia. The app searches ANZSCO codes and shows which visas they qualify for.

**Current Status:**
- Frontend: 90% complete with occupation detail pages showing ANZSCO hierarchy, descriptions, tasks, and visa eligibility
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with ~3,000 occupation codes
- Data Import: 3 unit groups complete (16 occupations with full data)
- Tech Stack: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Vercel

**I've uploaded SESSION_HANDOFF.md which contains:**
- Complete project overview
- Database schema
- Current workflow for adding ANZSCO data
- LLM prompt for processing unit groups
- All key files and patterns

**What I need help with today:**
[DESCRIBE YOUR CURRENT TASK - Examples:]
- "I want to process the next 5 unit groups (2631-2635)"
- "I need to fix a bug where [describe issue]"
- "I want to add a new feature for [describe feature]"
- "Can you review my progress and suggest next steps?"

**Please:**
1. Review the SESSION_HANDOFF.md document
2. Let me know you understand the current state
3. Help me continue where I left off

The project is live and working - database changes take effect immediately, code changes need git push.

Thanks!

**Alternative shorter version if context window is limited:**

Hi Claude! Continuing my Australian Migration Hub project (Next.js ANZSCO search tool). I've uploaded SESSION_HANDOFF.md with complete project context. Currently working on importing ANZSCO unit group data - 3 done, ~361 to go. Tech: Next.js/TypeScript/Supabase/Vercel. Can you review the handoff doc and help me [DESCRIBE TASK]?
